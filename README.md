## Projects

### 1. Mining Airline Delays for Clusters, Patterns, and Anomalies
- **Course:** *CSCI E-108 Data Mining*  
- **Description:** Analyzed the **ASA 2009 Airline On-Time Performance Dataset** using clustering (K-Means, DBSCAN, OPTICS, Agglomerative) and dimensionality reduction (PCA, UMAP, Spectral Embedding).  
- **Highlights:**
  - Identified delay patterns by routes, carriers, and airports  
  - Detected anomalies in flight delay structures  
  - Evaluated models using silhouette scores and Calinski-Harabasz index

## About me
I am a ***Masterâ€™s in Data Science candidate at Harvard University Extension School*** (graduating May 2026) with a strong foundation in machine learning, natural language processing, statistical modeling, and data engineering.

My experience spans building end-to-end ML pipelines, applying clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques for large datasets, and developing deep learning models for NLP and forecasting. I have hands-on expertise with modern tools such as Python, R, SQL, Spark, TensorFlow, PyTorch, AWS, and Databricks, and I focus on translating complex datasets into scalable, real-world solutions.

This portfolio highlights projects that combine academic rigor with practical applications, ranging from predictive modeling in healthcare to airline delay analytics, and upcoming coursework in MLOps, data engineering, and dynamic time series forecasting.

This repository demonstrates my technical and analytical skills across multiple areas of data science.
