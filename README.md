## Projects

### 1. Mining Airline Delays for Clusters, Patterns, and Anomalies
- **Course:** CSCI E-108 Data Mining  
- **Description:** Analyzed the **ASA 2009 Airline On-Time Performance Dataset** using clustering (K-Means, DBSCAN, OPTICS, Agglomerative) and dimensionality reduction (PCA, UMAP, Spectral Embedding).  
- **Highlights:**
  - Identified delay patterns by routes, carriers, and airports  
  - Detected anomalies in flight delay structures  
  - Evaluated models using silhouette scores and Calinski-Harabasz index

### 2. NLP Sentiment Analysis of IMDb Reviews
- **Course:** CSCI E-109 Advanced Topics in Data Science  
- **Description:**
  - Developed a deep learning NLP model (BERT + BiLSTM model) that predicts review sentiments with ~90% accuracy and ~94% precision
  - Built and evaluated multiple NLP models for sentiment classification on IMDb movie reviews.  
- **Highlights:**
  - Preprocessing with tokenization, embeddings, and sequence padding  
  - Implemented models: Logistic Regression, LSTMs, GRUs, and BERT  
  - Compared performance and discussed tradeoffs between classical ML and deep learning models  
- [Project Repository](./nlp_sentiment_analysis_project)
