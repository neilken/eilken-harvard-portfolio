# Upcoming Projects (Fall 2025 Coursework)

This file outlines upcoming graduate coursework projects that will be developed during Fall 2025 as part of my **Masterâ€™s in Data Science at Harvard University Extension School**.  
These projects will extend my portfolio into **MLOps, time series forecasting, and data engineering** with production-grade tools.

---

## MLOps with AWS and Docker  
**Course:** *CSCI E-115: Advanced Practical Data Science*  

- Building and deploying machine learning models using **Docker containers** and **AWS services** (S3, EC2, SageMaker).  
- Implementing **MLOps best practices** for CI/CD, version control, and automated retraining pipelines.  

---

## Time Series & Dynamic Modeling  
**Course:** *CSCI E-116: Dynamic Modeling and Forecasting in Big Data*  

- Applying **dynamic regression, vector autoregression (VAR), and state-space models** to high-frequency datasets.  
- Forecasting outcomes by decomposing **trend, cycle, and seasonality** in multivariate time series.  
- Comparing performance of advanced models against traditional approaches (e.g., ARIMA, exponential smoothing).

## Data Engineering with Spark and Databricks  
**Course:** *CSCI E-103: Data Engineering for Analytics*  

- Designing **ETL pipelines** on **Databricks and AWS** to integrate and transform large-scale datasets.  
- Leveraging **Spark, Delta Lake, and MLflow** to create scalable, reproducible data platforms.  
- Building enterprise-grade workflows for **data ingestion, processing, and analytics**.

## Next Steps  
These projects will be added to my portfolio repository as they are completed.  
In the meantime, you can explore my [current projects](../) including:  

- **[NLP Sentiment Analysis (BERT + BiLSTM)]()**  
- **[Airline Delay Data Mining (Clustering + Dimensionality Reduction)]()**
